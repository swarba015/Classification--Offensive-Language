## Overview
Binary text classification using Logistic Regression with NumPy and PyTorch. Compares performance across tokenization methods, optimizers, learning rates, and regularization.

## Key Features
1. Custom tokenizer with unigrams, bigrams, trigrams

2. Sparse matrix feature representation

3. PyTorch model with BCELoss, SGD/AdamW/RMSprop

4. Evaluation via F1 score, precision, recall
